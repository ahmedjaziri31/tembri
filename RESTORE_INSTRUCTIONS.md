# How to Restore the Original Home Page

## When Client Pays - Quick Restore

The original home page has been backed up. To restore it:

git add .
git commit -m "Restored original home page - payment received"
git push
```

### Option 2: Manual Restore
1. Go to `frontend/src/app/`
2. Delete the current `page.tsx`
3. Rename `page.tsx.backup` to `page.tsx`
4. Commit and push to Vercel
